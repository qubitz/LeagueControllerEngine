# League Controller Engine #

A prototype for visualizing how League of Legends could be played with a controller.

I created this engine to prototype/get-a-feel-for how a controller would integrate into League of Legends. In order to truly get the user experience I wanted, I implemented a custom keyboard and mouse output based on Xbox controller input to simulate output into Windows.

> NOTE: I was unable to get League of Legends to recogize the outputs from my program. I recommend full screening mspaint before use of the engine.
